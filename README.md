Idea Behind the App:

On new year's eve 2017, mass groping and molestation happend on MG Road, Bangalore. Police failed to target the people for enquiry. Everybody said, they were not present there, but u can see their regular story and post updates on insta and social networks. My app may help the authority to identify and Target the suspects in easy way.
